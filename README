NAME
    Perl::ToPerl6 - Critique Perl source code for best-practices.

SYNOPSIS
        use Perl::ToPerl6;
        my $file = shift;
        my $mogrify = Perl::ToPerl6->new();
        my @transformations = $mogrify->transform($file);
        print @transformations;

DESCRIPTION
    Perl::ToPerl6 is an extensible framework for creating and applying
    coding standards to Perl source code. Essentially, it is a static source
    code analysis engine. Perl::ToPerl6 is distributed with a number of
    Perl::ToPerl6::Transformer modules that attempt to enforce various
    coding guidelines. Most Transformer modules are based on Damian Conway's
    book Perl Best Practices. However, Perl::ToPerl6 is not limited to PBP
    and will even support Policies that contradict Conway. You can enable,
    disable, and customize those Polices through the Perl::ToPerl6
    interface. You can also create new Transformer modules that suit your
    own tastes.

    For a command-line interface to Perl::ToPerl6, see the documentation for
    perlmogrify. If you want to integrate Perl::ToPerl6 with your build
    process, Test::Perl::ToPerl6 provides an interface that is suitable for
    test programs. Also, Test::Perl::ToPerl6::Progressive is useful for
    gradually applying coding standards to legacy code. For the ultimate
    convenience (at the expense of some flexibility) see the mogrification
    pragma.

    If you'd like to try Perl::ToPerl6 without installing anything, there is
    a web-service available at <http://perlmogrify.com>. The web-service
    does not yet support all the configuration features that are available
    in the native Perl::ToPerl6 API, but it should give you a good idea of
    what it does.

    Also, ActivePerl includes a very slick graphical interface to
    Perl-ToPerl6 called "perlmogrify-gui". You can get a free community
    edition of ActivePerl from <http://www.activestate.com>.

INTERFACE SUPPORT
    This is considered to be a public class. Any changes to its interface
    will go through a deprecation cycle.

CONSTRUCTOR
    "new( [ -profile => $FILE, -severity => $N, -theme => $string, -include
    => \@PATTERNS, -exclude => \@PATTERNS, -top => $N, -only => $B,
    -profile-strictness => $PROFILE_STRICTNESS_{WARN|FATAL|QUIET}, -force =>
    $B, -verbose => $N ], -color => $B, -pager => $string, -allow-unsafe =>
    $B, -mogrification-fatal => $B)"
    "new()"
        Returns a reference to a new Perl::ToPerl6 object. Most arguments
        are just passed directly into Perl::ToPerl6::Config, but I have
        described them here as well. The default value for all arguments can
        be defined in your .perlmogrifyrc file. See the "CONFIGURATION"
        section for more information about that. All arguments are optional
        key-value pairs as follows:

        -profile is a path to a configuration file. If $FILE is not defined,
        Perl::ToPerl6::Config attempts to find a .perlmogrifyrc
        configuration file in the current directory, and then in your home
        directory. Alternatively, you can set the "PERLMOGRIFY" environment
        variable to point to a file in another location. If a configuration
        file can't be found, or if $FILE is an empty string, then all
        Policies will be loaded with their default configuration. See
        "CONFIGURATION" for more information.

        -severity is the minimum severity level. Only Transformer modules
        that have a severity greater than $N will be applied. Severity
        values are integers ranging from 1 (least severe transformations) to
        5 (most severe transformations). The default is 5. For a given
        "-profile", decreasing the "-severity" will usually reveal more
        Transformer transformations. You can set the default value for this
        option in your .perlmogrifyrc file. Users can redefine the severity
        level for any Transformer in their .perlmogrifyrc file. See
        "CONFIGURATION" for more information.

        If it is difficult for you to remember whether severity "5" is the
        most or least restrictive level, then you can use one of these named
        values:

            SEVERITY NAME   ...is equivalent to...   SEVERITY NUMBER
            --------------------------------------------------------
            -severity => 'gentle'                     -severity => 5
            -severity => 'stern'                      -severity => 4
            -severity => 'harsh'                      -severity => 3
            -severity => 'cruel'                      -severity => 2
            -severity => 'brutal'                     -severity => 1

        The names reflect how severely the code is mogrified: a "gentle"
        mogrification reports only the most severe transformations, and so
        on down to a "brutal" mogrification which reports even the most
        minor transformations.

        -theme is special expression that determines which Policies to apply
        based on their respective themes. For example, the following would
        load only Policies that have a 'bugs' AND 'pbp' theme:

          my $mogrify = Perl::ToPerl6->new( -theme => 'bugs && pbp' );

        Unless the "-severity" option is explicitly given, setting "-theme"
        silently causes the "-severity" to be set to 1. You can set the
        default value for this option in your .perlmogrifyrc file. See the
        "POLICY THEMES" section for more information about themes.

        -include is a reference to a list of string @PATTERNS. Transformer
        modules that match at least one "m/$PATTERN/ixms" will always be
        loaded, irrespective of all other settings. For example:

            my $mogrify = Perl::ToPerl6->new(-include => ['layout'] -severity => 4);

        This would cause Perl::ToPerl6 to apply all the "CodeLayout::*"
        Transformer modules even though they have a severity level that is
        less than 4. You can set the default value for this option in your
        .perlmogrifyrc file. You can also use "-include" in conjunction with
        the "-exclude" option. Note that "-exclude" takes precedence over
        "-include" when a Transformer matches both patterns.

        -exclude is a reference to a list of string @PATTERNS. Transformer
        modules that match at least one "m/$PATTERN/ixms" will not be
        loaded, irrespective of all other settings. For example:

            my $mogrify = Perl::ToPerl6->new(-exclude => ['strict'] -severity => 1);

        This would cause Perl::ToPerl6 to not apply the "RequireUseStrict"
        and "ProhibitNoStrict" Transformer modules even though they have a
        severity level that is greater than 1. You can set the default value
        for this option in your .perlmogrifyrc file. You can also use
        "-exclude" in conjunction with the "-include" option. Note that
        "-exclude" takes precedence over "-include" when a Transformer
        matches both patterns.

        -single-policy is a string "PATTERN". Only one policy that matches
        "m/$PATTERN/ixms" will be used. Policies that do not match will be
        excluded. This option has precedence over the "-severity", "-theme",
        "-include", "-exclude", and "-only" options. You can set the default
        value for this option in your .perlmogrifyrc file.

        -top is the maximum number of Transformations to return when ranked
        by their severity levels. This must be a positive integer.
        Transformations are still returned in the order that they occur
        within the file. Unless the "-severity" option is explicitly given,
        setting "-top" silently causes the "-severity" to be set to 1. You
        can set the default value for this option in your .perlmogrifyrc
        file.

        -only is a boolean value. If set to a true value, Perl::ToPerl6 will
        only choose from Policies that are mentioned in the user's profile.
        If set to a false value (which is the default), then Perl::ToPerl6
        chooses from all the Policies that it finds at your site. You can
        set the default value for this option in your .perlmogrifyrc file.

        -profile-strictness is an enumerated value, one of
        "$PROFILE_STRICTNESS_WARN" in Perl::ToPerl6::Utils::Constants (the
        default), "$PROFILE_STRICTNESS_FATAL" in
        Perl::ToPerl6::Utils::Constants, and "$PROFILE_STRICTNESS_QUIET" in
        Perl::ToPerl6::Utils::Constants. If set to
        "$PROFILE_STRICTNESS_FATAL" in Perl::ToPerl6::Utils::Constants,
        Perl::ToPerl6 will make certain warnings about problems found in a
        .perlmogrifyrc or file specified via the -profile option fatal. For
        example, Perl::ToPerl6 normally only "warn"s about profiles
        referring to non-existent Policies, but this value makes this
        situation fatal. Correspondingly, "$PROFILE_STRICTNESS_QUIET" in
        Perl::ToPerl6::Utils::Constants makes Perl::ToPerl6 shut up about
        these things.

        -force is a boolean value that controls whether Perl::ToPerl6
        observes the magical "## no mogrify" annotations in your code. If
        set to a true value, Perl::ToPerl6 will analyze all code. If set to
        a false value (which is the default) Perl::ToPerl6 will ignore code
        that is tagged with these annotations. See "BENDING THE RULES" for
        more information. You can set the default value for this option in
        your .perlmogrifyrc file.

        -verbose can be a positive integer (from 1 to 11), or a literal
        format specification. See Perl::ToPerl6::Transformation for an
        explanation of format specifications. You can set the default value
        for this option in your .perlmogrifyrc file.

        -unsafe directs Perl::ToPerl6 to allow the use of Policies that are
        marked as "unsafe" by the author. Such transformers may compile
        untrusted code or do other nefarious things.

        -color and -pager are not used by Perl::ToPerl6 but is provided for
        the benefit of perlmogrify.

        -mogrification-fatal is not used by Perl::ToPerl6 but is provided
        for the benefit of mogrification.

        -color-severity-highest, -color-severity-high, -color-severity-
        medium, -color-severity-low, and -color-severity-lowest are not used
        by Perl::ToPerl6, but are provided for the benefit of perlmogrify.
        Each is set to the Term::ANSIColor color specification to be used to
        display transformations of the corresponding severity.

        -files-with-transformations and -files-without-transformations are
        not used by Perl::ToPerl6, but are provided for the benefit of
        perlmogrify, to cause only the relevant filenames to be displayed.

METHODS
    "transform( $source_code )"
        Runs the $source_code through the Perl::ToPerl6 engine using all the
        Policies that have been loaded into this engine. If $source_code is
        a scalar reference, then it is treated as a string of actual Perl
        code. If $source_code is a reference to an instance of
        PPI::Document, then that instance is used directly. Otherwise, it is
        treated as a path to a local file containing Perl code. This method
        returns a list of Perl::ToPerl6::Transformation objects for each
        transformation of the loaded Policies. The list is sorted in the
        order that the Transformations appear in the code. If there are no
        transformations, this method returns an empty list.

    "apply_transform( -policy => $policy_name, -params => \%param_hash )"
        Creates a Transformer object and loads it into this ToPerl6. If the
        object cannot be instantiated, it will throw a fatal exception.
        Otherwise, it returns a reference to this ToPerl6.

        -policy is the name of a Perl::ToPerl6::Transformer subclass module.
        The 'Perl::ToPerl6::Transformer' portion of the name can be omitted
        for brevity. This argument is required.

        -params is an optional reference to a hash of Transformer
        parameters. The contents of this hash reference will be passed into
        to the constructor of the Transformer module. See the documentation
        in the relevant Transformer module for a description of the
        arguments it supports.

    " transformers() "
        Returns a list containing references to all the Transformer objects
        that have been loaded into this engine. Objects will be in the order
        that they were loaded.

    " config() "
        Returns the Perl::ToPerl6::Config object that was created for or
        given to this ToPerl6.

    " statistics() "
        Returns the Perl::ToPerl6::Statistics object that was created for
        this ToPerl6. The Statistics object accumulates data for all files
        that are analyzed by this ToPerl6.

FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE
    For those folks who prefer to have a functional interface, The
    "transform" method can be exported on request and called as a static
    function. If the first argument is a hashref, its contents are used to
    construct a new Perl::ToPerl6 object internally. The keys of that hash
    should be the same as those supported by the "Perl::ToPerl6::new()"
    method. Here are some examples:

        use Perl::ToPerl6 qw(transform);

        # Use default parameters...
        @transformations = transform( $some_file );

        # Use custom parameters...
        @transformations = transform( {-severity => 2}, $some_file );

        # As a one-liner
        %> perl -MPerl::ToPerl6=transform -e 'print transform(shift)' some_file.pm

    None of the other object-methods are currently supported as static
    functions. Sorry.

CONFIGURATION
    Most of the settings for Perl::ToPerl6 and each of the Transformer
    modules can be controlled by a configuration file. The default
    configuration file is called .perlmogrifyrc. Perl::ToPerl6 will look for
    this file in the current directory first, and then in your home
    directory. Alternatively, you can set the "PERLMOGRIFY" environment
    variable to explicitly point to a different file in another location. If
    none of these files exist, and the "-profile" option is not given to the
    constructor, then all the modules that are found in the
    Perl::ToPerl6::Transformer namespace will be loaded with their default
    configuration.

    The format of the configuration file is a series of INI-style blocks
    that contain key-value pairs separated by '='. Comments should start
    with '#' and can be placed on a separate line or after the name-value
    pairs if you desire.

    Default settings for Perl::ToPerl6 itself can be set before the first
    named block. For example, putting any or all of these at the top of your
    configuration file will set the default value for the corresponding
    constructor argument.

        severity  = 3                                     #Integer or named level
        only      = 1                                     #Zero or One
        force     = 0                                     #Zero or One
        verbose   = 4                                     #Integer or format spec
        top       = 50                                    #A positive integer
        theme     = (pbp || security) && bugs             #A theme expression
        include   = NamingConventions ClassHierarchies    #Space-delimited list
        exclude   = Variables  Modules::RequirePackage    #Space-delimited list
        mogrification-fatal = 1                           #Zero or One
        color     = 1                                     #Zero or One
        allow-unsafe = 1                                  #Zero or One
        pager     = less                                  #pager to pipe output to

    The remainder of the configuration file is a series of blocks like this:

        [Perl::ToPerl6::Transformer::Category::TransformerName]
        severity = 1
        set_themes = foo bar
        add_themes = baz
        maximum_transformations_per_document = 57
        arg1 = value1
        arg2 = value2

    "Perl::ToPerl6::Transformer::Category::TransformerName" is the full name
    of a module that implements the policy. The Transformer modules
    distributed with Perl::ToPerl6 have been grouped into categories
    according to the table of contents in Damian Conway's book Perl Best
    Practices. For brevity, you can omit the 'Perl::ToPerl6::Transformer'
    part of the module name.

    "severity" is the level of importance you wish to assign to the
    Transformer. All Transformer modules are defined with a default severity
    value ranging from 1 (least severe) to 5 (most severe). However, you may
    disagree with the default severity and choose to give it a higher or
    lower severity, based on your own coding philosophy. You can set the
    "severity" to an integer from 1 to 5, or use one of the equivalent
    names:

        SEVERITY NAME ...is equivalent to... SEVERITY NUMBER
        ----------------------------------------------------
        gentle                                             5
        stern                                              4
        harsh                                              3
        cruel                                              2
        brutal                                             1

    The names reflect how severely the code is mogrified: a "gentle"
    mogrification reports only the most severe transformations, and so on
    down to a "brutal" mogrification which reports even the most minor
    transformations.

    "set_themes" sets the theme for the Transformer and overrides its
    default theme. The argument is a string of one or more
    whitespace-delimited alphanumeric words. Themes are case-insensitive.
    See "POLICY THEMES" for more information.

    "add_themes" appends to the default themes for this Transformer. The
    argument is a string of one or more whitespace-delimited words. Themes
    are case- insensitive. See "POLICY THEMES" for more information.

    "maximum_transformations_per_document" limits the number of
    Transformations the Transformer will return for a given document. Some
    Policies have a default limit; see the documentation for the individual
    Policies to see whether there is one. To force a Transformer to not have
    a limit, specify "no_limit" or the empty string for the value of this
    parameter.

    The remaining key-value pairs are configuration parameters that will be
    passed into the constructor for that Transformer. The constructors for
    most Transformer objects do not support arguments, and those that do
    should have reasonable defaults. See the documentation on the
    appropriate Transformer module for more details.

    Instead of redefining the severity for a given Transformer, you can
    completely disable a Transformer by prepending a '-' to the name of the
    module in your configuration file. In this manner, the Transformer will
    never be loaded, regardless of the "-severity" given to the
    Perl::ToPerl6 constructor.

    A simple configuration might look like this:

        #--------------------------------------------------------------
        # I think these are really important, so always load them

        [TestingAndDebugging::RequireUseStrict]
        severity = 5

        [TestingAndDebugging::RequireUseWarnings]
        severity = 5

        #--------------------------------------------------------------
        # I think these are less important, so only load when asked

        [Variables::ProhibitPackageVars]
        severity = 2

        [ControlStructures::ProhibitPostfixControls]
        allow = if unless  # My custom configuration
        severity = cruel   # Same as "severity = 2"

        #--------------------------------------------------------------
        # Give these transformers a custom theme.  I can activate just
        # these transformers by saying `perlmogrify -theme larry`

        [Modules::RequireFilenameMatchesPackage]
        add_themes = larry

        [TestingAndDebugging::RequireTestLables]
        add_themes = larry curly moe

        #--------------------------------------------------------------
        # I do not agree with these at all, so never load them

        [-NamingConventions::Capitalization]
        [-ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitMagicNumbers]

        #--------------------------------------------------------------
        # For all other Policies, I accept the default severity,
        # so no additional configuration is required for them.

    For additional configuration examples, see the perlmogrifyrc file that
    is included in this examples directory of this distribution.

    Damian Conway's own Perl::ToPerl6 configuration is also included in this
    distribution as examples/perlmogrifyrc-conway.

THE POLICIES
    A large number of Transformer modules are distributed with
    Perl::ToPerl6. They are described briefly in the companion document
    Perl::ToPerl6::TransformerSummary and in more detail in the individual
    modules themselves. Say ""perlmogrify -doc PATTERN"" to see the perldoc
    for all Transformer modules that match the regex "m/PATTERN/ixms"

    There are a number of distributions of additional transformers on CPAN.
    If Perl::ToPerl6 doesn't contain a policy that you want, some one may
    have already written it. See the "SEE ALSO" section below for a list of
    some of these distributions.

POLICY THEMES
    Each Transformer is defined with one or more "themes". Themes can be
    used to create arbitrary groups of Policies. They are intended to
    provide an alternative mechanism for selecting your preferred set of
    Policies. For example, you may wish disable a certain subset of Policies
    when analyzing test programs. Conversely, you may wish to enable only a
    specific subset of Policies when analyzing modules.

    The Policies that ship with Perl::ToPerl6 have been broken into the
    following themes. This is just our attempt to provide some basic logical
    groupings. You are free to invent new themes that suit your needs.

        THEME             DESCRIPTION
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------
        core              All transformers that ship with Perl::ToPerl6
        pbp               Policies that come directly from "Perl Best Practices"
        bugs              Policies that that prevent or reveal bugs
        certrec           Policies that CERT recommends
        certrule          Policies that CERT considers rules
        maintenance       Policies that affect the long-term health of the code
        cosmetic          Policies that only have a superficial effect
        complexity        Policies that specificaly relate to code complexity
        security          Policies that relate to security issues
        tests             Policies that are specific to test programs

    Any Transformer may fit into multiple themes. Say "perlmogrify -list" to
    get a listing of all available Policies and the themes that are
    associated with each one. You can also change the theme for any
    Transformer in your .perlmogrifyrc file. See the "CONFIGURATION" section
    for more information about that.

    Using the "-theme" option, you can create an arbitrarily complex rule
    that determines which Policies will be loaded. Precedence is the same as
    regular Perl code, and you can use parentheses to enforce precedence as
    well. Supported operators are:

    Theme names are case-insensitive. If the "-theme" is set to an empty
    string, then it evaluates as true all Policies.

BENDING THE RULES
    Perl::ToPerl6 takes a hard-line approach to your code: either you comply
    or you don't. In the real world, it is not always practical (nor even
    possible) to fully comply with coding standards. In such cases, it is
    wise to show that you are knowingly violating the standards and that you
    have a Damn Good Reason (DGR) for doing so.

    To help with those situations, you can direct Perl::ToPerl6 to ignore
    certain lines or blocks of code by using annotations:

        require 'LegacyLibaray1.pl';  ## no mogrify
        require 'LegacyLibrary2.pl';  ## no mogrify

        for my $element (@list) {

            ## no mogrify

            $foo = "";               #Violates 'ProhibitEmptyQuotes'
            $barf = bar() if $foo;   #Violates 'ProhibitPostfixControls'
            #Some more evil code...

            ## use mogrify

            #Some good code...
            do_something($_);
        }

    The "## no mogrify" annotations direct Perl::ToPerl6 to ignore the
    remaining lines of code until a "## use mogrify" annotation is found. If
    the ""## no mogrify"" annotation is on the same line as a code
    statement, then only that line of code is overlooked. To direct
    perlmogrify to ignore the ""## no mogrify"" annotations, use the
    "--force" option.

    A bare "## no mogrify" annotation disables all the active Policies. If
    you wish to disable only specific Policies, add a list of Transformer
    names as arguments, just as you would for the "no strict" or "no
    warnings" pragmas. For example, this would disable the
    "ProhibitEmptyQuotes" and "ProhibitPostfixControls" transformers until
    the end of the block or until the next "## use mogrify" annotation
    (whichever comes first):

        ## no mogrify (EmptyQuotes, PostfixControls)

        # Now exempt from ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitEmptyQuotes
        $foo = "";

        # Now exempt ControlStructures::ProhibitPostfixControls
        $barf = bar() if $foo;

        # Still subjected to ValuesAndExpression::RequireNumberSeparators
        $long_int = 10000000000;

    Since the Transformer names are matched against the "## no mogrify"
    arguments as regular expressions, you can abbreviate the Transformer
    names or disable an entire family of Policies in one shot like this:

        ## no mogrify (NamingConventions)

        # Now exempt from NamingConventions::Capitalization
        my $camelHumpVar = 'foo';

        # Now exempt from NamingConventions::Capitalization
        sub camelHumpSub {}

    The argument list must be enclosed in parentheses and must contain one
    or more comma-separated barewords (e.g. don't use quotes). The "## no
    mogrify" annotations can be nested, and Policies named by an inner
    annotation will be disabled along with those already disabled an outer
    annotation.

    Some Policies like "Subroutines::ProhibitExcessComplexity" apply to an
    entire block of code. In those cases, the "## no mogrify" annotation
    must appear on the line where the transformation is reported. For
    example:

        sub complicated_function {  ## no mogrify (ProhibitExcessComplexity)
            # Your code here...
        }

    Policies such as "Documentation::RequirePodSections" apply to the entire
    document, in which case transformations are reported at line 1.

    Use this feature wisely. "## no mogrify" annotations should be used in
    the smallest possible scope, or only on individual lines of code. And
    you should always be as specific as possible about which Policies you
    want to disable (i.e. never use a bare "## no mogrify"). If
    Perl::ToPerl6 complains about your code, try and find a compliant
    solution before resorting to this feature.

THE Perl::ToPerl6 PHILOSOPHY
    Coding standards are deeply personal and highly subjective. The goal of
    Perl::ToPerl6 is to help you write code that conforms with a set of best
    practices. Our primary goal is not to dictate what those practices are,
    but rather, to implement the practices discovered by others. Ultimately,
    you make the rules -- Perl::ToPerl6 is merely a tool for encouraging
    consistency. If there is a policy that you think is important or that we
    have overlooked, we would be very grateful for contributions, or you can
    simply load your own private set of transformers into Perl::ToPerl6.

EXTENDING THE MOGRIFIER
    The modular design of Perl::ToPerl6 is intended to facilitate the
    addition of new Policies. You'll need to have some understanding of PPI,
    but most Transformer modules are pretty straightforward and only require
    about 20 lines of code. Please see the Perl::ToPerl6::DEVELOPER file
    included in this distribution for a step-by-step demonstration of how to
    create new Transformer modules.

    If you develop any new Transformer modules, feel free to send them to
    "<team@perlmogrify.com>" and I'll be happy to consider adding them into
    the Perl::ToPerl6 distribution. Or if you would like to work on the
    Perl::ToPerl6 project directly, you can fork our repository at
    "/github.com/Perl- ToPerl6/Perl- ToPerl6.git" in http:.

    The Perl::ToPerl6 team is also available for hire. If your organization
    has its own coding standards, we can create custom Policies to enforce
    your local guidelines. Or if your code base is prone to a particular
    defect pattern, we can design Policies that will help you catch those
    costly defects before they go into production. To discuss your needs
    with the Perl::ToPerl6 team, just contact "<team@perlmogrify.com>".
