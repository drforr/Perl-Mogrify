# This file is an example of a Perl::Mogrify configuration file.  This
# file is usually called ".perlmogrifyrc" and is usually located in
# your home directory or the working directory of your project.
# However, you can use the -profile option to tell Perl::Mogrify use a
# different file in another location.
#
# The area before any of the [Perl::Mogrify::Transformer] sections is used
# to set default values for the arguments to the Perl::Mogrify engine.
# If you are using the "perlmogrify" program, you can override these
# settings at the command-line.  Or if you are using the Perl::Mogrify
# library, your API arguments will override these settings as well.
